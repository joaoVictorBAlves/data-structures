In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.

`There are many types of data structures, see below:`

### Types of data structures:

## Linear Data Structures

### 1) List
List is a kind of data structure which is made up of nodes, each node has a value and dot by the next node. List has some methods, see below:
* Add nodes in any index
* Remove nodes in any index
* Replace nodes
* Go through a list and acess any index

There are two kind of lists, the `singly linked list` and the `double linked list`

### 2) Stack 
Stacks are data structures that store elements in a sequential format, stacking one item on top of another. Stacks is structures of type LIFO(_Last in First out_)

Stack has some methods, see below:
* Stack up or push is add a data on the top in the stack
* Stack out or pop is remove a data on the top of the stack
* We can't acess any index, we just can acess the data in on the top of stack
* To replace an item it is necessary to unstack the data, replace  and re-stack data again

### 3) Queue
A queue is a dynamic data structure that supports removing elements and inserting new objects. More specifically, a queue is a structure subject to the following rule of operation: whenever there is an eviction, the evicted element is the one that has been in the structure the longest. Queue is FIFO(_Fist in Firs Out_)

Queue has some methods, see below:
* Enqueue is add a data on the back of the queue
* Dequeue is remove a data on the front of the queue

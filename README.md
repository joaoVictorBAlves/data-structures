In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.

`There are many types of data structures, see below:`

### Types of data structures:

### 1) List
List is a kind of data structure which is made up of nodes, each node has a value and dot by the next node. List has some methods, see below:
* Add nodes in any index
* Remove nodes in any index
* Replace nodes
* Go through a list and acess any index

There are two kind of lists, the `singly linked list` and the `double linked list`
